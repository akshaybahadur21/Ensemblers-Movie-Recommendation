# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

The templates are copied from the [pythonFlaskConnexion folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators/tree/master/src/main/resources/handlebars/pythonFlaskConnexion) 
under [swagger-codegen-generators](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators), commit id `0c69d21044bc4f25584ac4a736d9fd13d432c70f`.
